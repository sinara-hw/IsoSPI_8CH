# IsoSPI_8CH
This is an 8-channel IsoSPI with PoDL for remote front ends and sensors
The main application is multi-channel measurement using SPI sensors with just two twisted wires.
Example applications include magnetic field measurement, currents, temperatures, and light intensity.

Features:
- 8 IsoSPI ports
- 5V 300mA power over twisted pair
- optional shield terminals
- for the moment, a compatible magnetic field sensor was developed based on MMC5983MA 3D sensor
- EEM and DI/OT form factor
- up to 1Mbit/s data rate
